     ```sh
     git clone https://github.com/np-nandanpatil/ChromeExtension.git

2. Open Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions/`.
3. Enable "Developer mode" by clicking the toggle switch in the top right corner.
4. Click the "Load unpacked" button and select the cloned directory.

## Usage

- The extension will display a random quote from whenever you open a new tab.
